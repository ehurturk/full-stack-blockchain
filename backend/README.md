# Basic Blockchain API Backend

I am using the Ropsten testnet with Alchemy API as a network and provider. The token is called "SpinCoin (SPC)" and is a ERC20 coin. Its deployement address is 0x5322f0AA79e7e7d5Bb23F9A53E4656C4D880Ad15. You can visit ropsten testnet etherscan to see this token in action.
